                            Release Notes
            
            
CHANGES IN 2.10.0 --------------------------------------------------------

    o Generified BindingConverter.
    o Added ActionBindingBuilder#to(JComboBox).
    o Added PresentationModel#setComponentEditable(String, boolean).
    o Added PresentationModel#setComponentEnabled(String, boolean).
    o Added PresentationModel#setComponentVisible(String, boolean).
    o Performance improvement in BeanUtils.
    o PropertyAccessor messages regarding missing getter or setters
      provide details about the bean, bean class and missing method.
    o Attempts to read or write a bean property that fail due 
      to a missing (or non-public) reader or writer now throw
      a PropertyAccessException not an UnsupportedOperationException.
    o Improved JavaDocs.
      

CHANGES IN 2.9.0 --------------------------------------------------------

    This version adds support for binding sorted JTables. It is binary
    compatible with previous versions. However, there's a significant
    change in the behavior of the binding to sorted tables.
    
    If a JTable has a RowSorter, its selection model reflects the table's 
    sort state. In other words, sorting modifies the selection indices. 
    This makes it difficult to share ListSelectionModels for multiple 
    sorted JTables.
    
    In previous Binding versions 
       Bindings.bind(table, listModel, listSelectionModel)
    set the given listSelectionModel directly to the table's.
    Sorting the table via the standard RowSorter mechanism
    has modified this selection model's indices.
    
    Since version 2.9
       Bindings.bind(table, listModel, listSelectionModel)
    sets a TableRowSorterListSelectionModel as the table's selection model
    that is then synchronized with the given listSelectionModel.
    Sorting the table keeps the listSelectionModel's indices stable.
    
    Migration info: If you don't use the JTable RowSorter mechanism,
    you're done. If you bind to sorted tables without the Bindings class
    or Binder feature, you're done too.
    Only if you bind via Bindings or the Binder feature to JTables
    that use RowSorters, you should be aware that the indices of
    bound ListSelectionModels do no longer change on sort operations.
    Likely you can remove code that maps sorted indices to unsorted ones.


CHANGES IN 2.8.0 --------------------------------------------------------

    o Since this version is compiled against the JGoodies Common 1.5
      all Bean and Model subclasses do not serialize listeners.
    o Removed the deprecated AbstractConverter class that has been
      replaced by the BindingConverter and ConverterValueModel before.
    o Removed deprecated constants, that have been replaced before,
      e.g. PROPERTYNAME_XXX  -> PROPERTY_XXX 
    o Reduced the former public visibility to protected for methods
      PresentationModel#beforeBeanChange and #afterBeanChange.
    o Added PresentationModel#onBeanChanging and #onBeanChanged.
    o Source code cleanup.
    o Fixed and extended the pom.xml:
      - added schema
      - fixed scope for dependencies
      - added Maven Central deployer
      - added build data


CHANGES IN 2.7.0 --------------------------------------------------------

    o Added the BindingConverter interface that describes objects
      that convert binding source values to binding target values
      and vice versa.
    o Added ValueModelBindingBuilder#converted(BindingConverter)
      that is similar but more general than #formatted(Format).
      For example, you can write:
      binder.bindBeanProperty("price")
            .converted(currencyConverter)
            .to(priceField);
    o Added ConverterValueModel that wraps a ValueModel and converts
      values using a BindingConverter.
    o The conversion classes provided by the ConverterFactory 
      have been rewritten to implement the BindingConverter interface.
      These classes are public and can be used
    o Marked AbstractConverter as deprecated.
      This class will be removed from a future library version.
    o Added ObjectBinder#bind(Object[], ListSelectionModel).
    o Slightly overhauled the binder mechanism:
      - added ActionObjectBinderImpl (from JSDL Sandbox)
      - added ActionBeanBinderImpl (from JSDL Sandbox)
      - added ActionPresentationModelImpl (from JSDL Sandbox)
      - replaced BasicBinders by the Binders (from JSDL Sandbox)
      - added internal interfaces for classes not included in this lib:
        ActionObject, ActionBean, and ActionPresentationModel
    o Added Bindings#bind(JComboBox, ComboBoxModel, String nullText).
    o Added ObjectBinder.bind(ComboBoxModel).to(aComboBox) and
            ObjectBinder.bind(ComboBoxModel).to(aComboBox, aNullText).
    

CHANGES IN 2.6.1 --------------------------------------------------------

    o Added the PresentationModel() constructor that sets a null bean.
    o Renamed property constants from PROPERTYNAME_* to PROPERTY_*
    o The javadocs, main and test sources are delivered as JARs.


CHANGES IN 2.6.0 --------------------------------------------------------

    o Requires Java 6 and the JGoodies Common 1.3.
    o Removed deprecated property constant names from
      ComponentValueModel that have been replaced by
      the same constants in ComponentModel before.


CHANGES IN 2.5.1 --------------------------------------------------------

    This maintenance update comes with minor implementation improvements 
    and slightly better documentation.


CHANGES IN 2.5.0 --------------------------------------------------------

    Added the interfaces ActionObjectBinder, ActionBeanBinder, and 
    ActionPresentationModelBinder that add binding capabilities for 
    Action names to ObjectBinder, BeanBinder, PresentationModelBinder.
      
    Implementations will typically look up an Action for a given
    action name and hand it over to the Action-instance binding
    of an ObjectBinder implementation.
      
    The library does not contain implementations, because there's no
    popular and public standard that describes and implements how to
    look up an Action for a name. A popular approach is the JSR 296
    (Swing Application Framework) that enables developers to annotate
    methods with @Action that then can be requested for a target object
    and an action name.
      
    Since the JGoodies implementation of the JSR 296 (the JGoodies 
    "Application" library) is not available to the general public,
    the JGoodies Application-based implementations of the above 
    interfaces are not part of the Binding library.
    
    However, the new binder interfaces reduce the effort to integrate
    your custom Action-lookup and binder mechanism that may be based
    on the JSR 296 or any other Action name registry.


CHANGES IN 2.4.1 --------------------------------------------------------

    o ComponentModel extends ObservableBean2 instead of ObservableBean.
    o Changed the return type for PresentationModel#getComponentModel 
      and #getBufferedComponentModel to AbstractWrappedValueModel
      which implements ComponentValueModel but provides more features.
    
                        
CHANGES IN 2.4.0 --------------------------------------------------------
                        
INTRODUCTION

    This version is binary incompatible with previous releases
    and converters behave slightly different due to a new feature.
    However, the vast majority of API users won't be affected
    by these changes and can use this update as a compatible version.

CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o Removed ValueModelBindingBuilder#converted(AbstractConverter)
    o Renamed ValueModelBindingBuilder#converted(Format) to #formatted.
    o ComponentValueModel is now an interface.
    o The old ComponentValueModel implementation has been overhauled
      and is now available as DefaultComponentValueModel.
    o AbstractConverter extends ComponentValueModel.
    o AbstractConverter listens to enabled/visible/editable changes,
      if the wrapped model is a ComponentValueModel
    o The binding to check boxes, check box menu items, radio buttons,
      and radio button menu items has been generalized.
      The Bindings class as well as ValueModelBindingBuilder now accept
      general AbstractButtons instead of JCheckBox/JRadioButton.
      The binding style (check box vs. radio choice) depends on the
      number of parameters; the radio style has the choice parameter.
      - Bindings#bind(JCheckBox,      ValueModel) is now
                #bind(AbstractButton, ValueModel).
      - Bindings#bind(JRadioButton,   ValueModel, Object choice) is now
                #bind(AbstractButton, ValueModel, Object choice).
      - ValueModelBindingBuilder#to(JCheckBox) became
                                #to(AbstractButton).
      - ValueModelBindingBuilder#to(JRadioButton,   Object) became
                                #to(AbstractButton, Object).               
    
NEW FEATURES

    o Added the ComponentModel interface.
    o Added AbstractWrappedValueModel.
    o BeanBinder accepts general beans (required AbstractBean before).
    o Added check box style binding via Bindings#bind(AbstractButton, 
                          Object selectedValue,
                          Object deselectedValue)
      and bind*(*).to(anAbstractButton, selectedValue, deselectedValue)
    

OTHER CHANGES

    o Declared methods as static where possible.


CHANGES IN 2.3.0 --------------------------------------------------------
                        
INTRODUCTION

    This version is backwards compatible with previous releases.
    It adds a new mechanism to bind bean properties, presentation
    model properties, SelectionInLists, and Actions to components,
    see package com.jgoodies.binding.binder. You can now write:
    
    PresentationModelBinder binder = 
        new PresentationModelBinderImpl(model);

    // A property of the presentation model
    binder.bindProperty("synthetic").to(aComponent);
               
    // Bean properties
    binder.bindBeanProperty(PROPERTY_TITLE)    .to(titleField);
    binder.bindBeanProperty(PROPERTY_CLASSICAL).to(classicalBox);
    binder.bindBeanProperty(PROPERTY_ALIGNMENT).to(leftRadio, LEFT);
    
    // SelectionInLists
    binder.bindBeanProperty(PROPERTY_SELECTION)
          .asSelectionIn(SELECTION_VALUES)     .to(aComboBox);
    binder.bind(aSelectionInList)              .to(aComboBox)
    binder.bind(aSelectionInList)              .to(aList)
    binder.bind(aSelectionInList)              .to(aTable
            
    // Actions
    binder.bind(anAction).to(aButton);
    binder.bind(anAction).to(aTextField);

            
OTHER CHANGES

    o Added Bindings#bind(JComboBox, SelectionInList, String nullText)
      that binds the combo box to a list with an optional element
      that is mapped to null and displayed with the given nullText.

            
CHANGES IN 2.2.2 --------------------------------------------------------
                        
    This update fixes a minor bug with missing content changes
    in the LinkedListModel list iterator.        

            
CHANGES IN 2.2.1 --------------------------------------------------------
                        
    This update fixes a critical bug with missing table events
    in the AbstractTableAdapter that has been introduced in 2.2.0.        
                

CHANGES IN 2.2.0 --------------------------------------------------------
                        
INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release is a cleanup release where deprecated
    classes have been removed. Also, it enables a faster lookup of
    bean classes that have no associated BeanInfo class - as is the
    case in almost all domain classes.

CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o Removed BeanUtils#getValue(Object)
    o Removed BeanUtils#setValue(Object, PropertyDescriptor)
    o Removed BeanUtils#getPropertyDescriptor
    o Replaced Observable with ObservableBean from Common 1.1.
    
NEW FEATURES

    o Added support for binding table's to ListModels.
      - introduced the ListModelBindable interface
      - AbstractTableAdapter implement ListModelBindable
      - added Bindings#bind(JTable, SelectionInList)
      - added Bindings#bind(JTable, ListModel, ListSelectionModel)   
      - added BasicComponentFactory#createTable 
    o Added a feature for faster bean property lookup. 
      Useful if no bean info classes are used and so the class lookup
      can be omitted. To setup the faster lookup call PropertyAccessors'
      #setProvider(new FastPropertyAccessorProviderDraft());
      The latter ships with the source code extras.
    o Added BeanAdapter.SimplePropertyAdapter#fireChange(Object, Object).
    o PropertyAdapter and BeanAdapter are serializable.

OTHER CHANGES

    o BufferedValueModel#setSubject improved to reduce
      unnecessary read exceptions when the old subject is null.
    o Suppressed warnings for some tests.
    o BeanUtils uses ObservableBean and ObservableBean2 instead of Model
      which will slightly improve the registration of listeners. 
    o Improved JavaDocs, fixed compiler warnings.
    o Updated references in the distribution docs.
    
    
CHANGES IN 2.1.0 --------------------------------------------------------
                        
    This maintenance release uses and requires the JGoodies Common lib.
    Make sure that you include jgoodies-common-1.0.0.jar in your
    classpath when using this Binding version.
    
    
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o BasicComponentFactory#createCheckBox and #createRadioButton
      now accept a marked text that may contain a mnemonic marker
      ('&') to mark the mnemonic and its index. See MnemonicUtils
      for details about this configuration.
      Also, the content area of the returned components is now
      not filled. This is typically, if a check box or radio button
      is contained in a panel with a gradient background, for example
      tabbed panes in many Windows L&f configurations.
    o Removed EmptyDateFormatter and EmptyNumberFormatter.
      These have been replaced by the new JGoodies Common classes
      EmptyDateFormat and EmptyNumberFormat. 
      Adjusted the BasicComponentFactory to use the new classes.
      
      
BUG FIXES

    #134: Binding via Bindings looses AbstractButton properties.
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Marked ArrayListModel, LinkedListModel, and ObservableList
      as deprecated. These classes have been replaced by new versions
      from the JGoodies Common library. The Binding classes will be
      removed from the next Binding version.
    o Fixed a few JavaDocs.
    
    
CHANGES IN 2.0.6 --------------------------------------------------------

    This maintenance release fixes a regression introduced by the
    parameter strings for ValueModels created by BeanAdapters and 
    PropertyAdapters. The #toString method of a ValueModel returned
    by a Bean- or PropertyAdapter on a null bean failed with an NPE.

    
CHANGES IN 2.0.5 --------------------------------------------------------

    This maintenance release reverts a change made in the Binding 2.0.4
    that lead to an incompatible serialization of Model subclasses.
    2.0.4 introduced a feature in the ExtendedPropertyChangeSupport
    to ensure that listeners are notified in the event dispatch thread.
    This feature was unused and has now been removed to make version
    2.0.5 binary compatible with versions 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, and 2.0.3.
    
    o Source code improvement: uses arrays for copying listener lists.
    o Replaced LinkedList by ArrayList.
    o Updated the Forms library used for the tutorial to 1.3.0 pre1.
    o Slightly overhauled the visual design of the tutorial screens.
      Added mnemonics and colons where, replaced some titles and 
      titled separators by labels, removed unnecessary separators.
    
    
CHANGES IN 2.0.4 --------------------------------------------------------

    This maintenance release adds a public API to the delaying classes 
    to check whether there are one or more pending events. The #release 
    methods in PresentationModel, BeanAdapter, PropertyAdapter, 
    TextComponentConnector, and PropertyConnector can be called 
    multiple times (issue #108).
    
    o Added #isPending to DelayedPropertyChangeHandler, 
      DelayedReadValueModel and DelayedWriteValueModel.
    o More final methods in DelayedPropertyChangeHandler.
    o Added tests for calling release multiple times.

    
CHANGES IN 2.0.3 --------------------------------------------------------

    This maintenance release improves the debug output for subclasses
    of AbstractValueModel and ships improved tutorial sources and 
    slightly improved JavaDocs.

    o Added AbstractValueModel#paramString and #valueString.
    o Implemented #paramString in BufferedValueModel, PropertyAdapter,
      and BeanAdapter.SimplePropertyAdapter.
    o Updated the Forms library used for the tutorial to 1.2.0.
    o The download link in the HTML pages points to JGoodies.com.
    
    
CHANGES IN 2.0.2 --------------------------------------------------------

    #127: PresentationModel constructors shall use the bean type.
          Changed PresentationModel(Object) and
          PresentationModel(Object, ValueModel) to
          PresentationModel(B) and PresentationModel(B, ValueModel).
    #128: Make AbstractConverter#release non-final
    
    o PropertyConnector always reads the new value,
      if the property name is null.
    o Simpler generic types in some tutorial examples.
    o Updated copyright information.
    o Updated the Forms library used for the tutorial to 1.2b2.
    
    
CHANGES IN 2.0.1 --------------------------------------------------------
    
BUGS FIXED

    #122: Broken SelectionInList#setSelectionIndex upper bound check
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    #123: Improved the SelectionInList JavaDocs regarding null selections
          if the List or ListModel contains null.
          
    o Added Bindings#flushImmediately() and #isFocusOwnerBuffering().
    o Corrected the IndirectListModel documentation.
    
    
CHANGES IN 2.0.0 --------------------------------------------------------
    
    With this major update the JGoodies Binding has been moved to Java 5. 
    Key classes and methods have been generified, sources use annotations, 
    and the code uses the enhanced for loop.
    This version is binary incompatible with previous versions. 
    
    
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o Replaced the 1.5 SelectionInList and SelectionInListModel by 
      the 1.4 SelectionInList. Replaced ListHolder, ListModelHolder
      by IndirectListModel. 
    o Added #getList() to SelectionInList and IndirectListModel.
    o SelectionInList#getListModel throws a ClassCastException
      if the list holder doesn't hold a ListModel.
    o Generified the following classes: ArrayListModel, LinkedListModel, 
      SelectionInList, IndirectListModel, AbstractTableAdapter, 
      PresentationModel, BeanAdapter, and PropertyAdapter.
    o PropertyConnector constructor is private, use #connect instead.
    o PropertyConnector#connect returns the PropertyConnector. 
    o Bindings#bind(JComboBox, SelectionInList) and 
      #bind(JList, SelectionInList) synchronize the component
      properties "visible" and "enabled" with the SelectionInList's
      selection holder, if this is a ComponentValueModel.
    

BUGS FIXED

    #119: SelectionInList may fire wrong ListDataEvents.
        
    
NEW FEATURES

    o Added PropertyConnector#connectAndUpdate(ValueModel, Object, String)
    o AbstractTableAdapter#getRow is public
    o AbstractTableAdapter constructor with column names uses varargs.


OTHER CHANGES

    o Source code cleanup: enhanced for loop, annotations, 
      marked private fields as final, removed trailing blanks.
    o Fixed JavaDoc typos.
    
    
HOW TO MIGRATE FROM VERSION 1.4 TO 2.0

    o Add type information to ArrayListModels, LinkedListModels, 
      SelectionInLists, SelectionInListModels, PresentationModels,
      BeanAdapters, PropertyAdapters, AbstractTableAdapters.
    o Remove unnecessary type casts.
    o Replace PropertyConnector constructor calls by
      PropertyConnector#connect or #connectAndUpdate.
     

CHANGES PLANNED FOR FUTURE VERSIONS

    o ExtendedPropertyChangeSupport shall:
       + provide an optional weak registration of listeners,
       + an option to notify listeners in the event-dispatch-thread,
       + add debug features to detect inconsistencies between 
        a bean's property names and the names used to register
        a listener or used to fire a property change.

                        JGoodies Data Binding
                            Version 1.5.0
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This version is the first step towards the generified Binding 2.0.
    It is binary incompatible with previous versions. Stable extras
    have been moved to the core, and the SelectionInList has changed.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    #118: BeanAdapter#getValue, #setValue bypass internal adapter.
    
    
NEW FEATURES

    o SelectionInListModel is now in the core. The Bindings class
      and the BasicComponentFactory have been extended to bind or 
      create JComboBoxes and JLists from SelectionInListModel.
    o The old SelectionInList that worked with List and ListModel
      has been replaced by a new SelectionInList that works with
      List only.
    o Added DelayedPropertyChangeHandler#getDelay and #setDelay.
    o Moved the ChangeTracker and LoggingUtils from extras to core.


HOW TO MIGRATE TO VERSION 1.5

    o For every 1.4 SelectionInList you should check whether it
      works with a ListModel vs. List or Array. In the first case,
      use a SelectionInListModel; for List and Arrays you can keep
      the SelectionInList.

                        JGoodies Data Binding
                            Version 1.4.0
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release comes with a behavior change in the PropertyConnector
    and extends the API to make it easier to subclass the BeanAdapter.
    
    This version is binary compatible with the 1.3.x versions,
    but the changed behavior was worth a new minor version number.
    However, most API users won't notice the difference and will
    just benefit from the PropertyConnector change.
    
    The PropertyConnector change improves a nasty situation with
    JFormattedTextFields that fire unnecessary "value" change events,
    if a user clicks in a formatted text field without changing it.
    If the value is null, a bean property connected to such a field
    will likely fire a property change event, because null may
    indicate a null value or 'unknown'. The default binding for
    JFormattedTextField is implemented with the PropertyConnector.
    
    The new PropertyConnector reads a target value and compares it
    with the value to be set. In case these are identical, no
    operation will be performed, and no change event will be fired.
    This addresses the case where the JFormattedTextField sends
    a change event from null to null. And it avoids unnecessary
    events in other situations too.
    
    
NEW FEATURES

    o BeanAdapter.SimplePropertyAdapter not final.
    o BeanAdapter.SimplePropertyAdapter constructor protected
      as well as #fireChange and #setBean0
    o Added BeanAdapter#createPropertyAdapter.


OTHER CHANGES

    #117: PropertyConnector shall not fire unnecessary change events
    o Updated the Forms library used for the tutorial to version 1.1.

                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release fixes a bug in ListModel implementations and a regression
    with the PropertyConnector and read-only properties.

                        JGoodies Data Binding
                            Version 1.3.1
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release changes the behavior of the PropertyConnector
    in the case that a target bean setter modifies the value set,
    or completely rejects the new value (issue #114). For example, 
    a bean setter may trim a String or turn it into upper case.
    
    If setters don't modify or reject values, the old and new
    behavior are almost identical. The difference is in an extra
    read operation on the target bean side, that is used to compare
    the value set with the (potentially modified ) target value.
    
    The new behavior is now consistent with the TextComponentConnector
    that honors subject value modifications too.
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Removed the deprecated BeanUtils#getPropertyDescriptor methods.
    o Added a test case that the SelectionInList handles
      vetos in a custom selection index holder.

                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release contains a few binary incompatible changes.
    
    
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE BINARY COMPATIBILITY

    o Removed the deprecated DocumentAdapter that has been replaced
      by the TextComponentConnector in version 1.2.
    o Removed Bindings#bind(ValueModel, JTextArea, Document, boolean) and
      Bindings#bind(ValueModel, JTextField, Document, boolean) that have been
      marked as deprecated in version 1.2.


NEW FEATURES

    #112: Poor bean channel construction in PresentationModel.
      Added PresentationModel#createBeanAdapter(ValueModel).
      PresentationModel subclasses may override this method to configure
      the bean adapter, for example whether it observes changes or not.
    o BeanAdapter is no longer final.
    o Added BeanAdapter#getBeanChannel.
    o Added Model#firePropertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent) that allows
      to fire IndexedPropertyChangeEvents in Java 5 or later.
    o Added Model#fireVetoableChange(PropertyChangeEvent).
    #109: Add AbstractConverter#release

                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release brings a few improvements and API extensions.

    
NEW FEATURES

     51: Added LoggingUtils to the source code extras.
         Reduces the effort required to log property changes.
         
     98: Bindings#bind(JComponent, String, ValueModel) reduces the
         effort required to bind a component property to a ValueModel.
         
    103: PresentationModel#release. Setting the bean to null is
         still the preferred method to release listeners.
    
    104: SelectionInList#release, 
         ListHolder#release, 
         ListModelHolder#release,
         SpinnerToValueModelConnector#release,
         SelectionInList2#release
         SelectionInListModel#release
         Instead of calling these #release methods, you typically
         release the PresentationModel or BeanAdapter that has created
         the (Value)Models used in the above classes.
         
    106: Bindings#commitImmediately() is useful to commit a pending edit.
    
       o DelayedPropertyChangeHandler#stop.
       o DelayedReadValueModel#stop.
       o DelayedWriteValueModel#stop.
    

CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE BINARY COMPATIBILITY

    o Removed the deprecated Model#fireMulticastPropertyChange, which 
      has been replaced by #fireMultiplePropertiesChanged in 1.0.3.


CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR 

    101: Model's change support is non-transient. And so serializable
         listeners will be serialized with the observed Model.
         AbstractConverter uses a PropertyChangeListener instead
         of implementing PropertyChangeListener.
         Most Binding API users register listeners with the
         Binding classes, not the Model directly. And so, 
         this change won't affect most users. The change affects 
         only those who register listeners with a Model diretly.
         
    105: After a text update the caret is now at position 0,
         where it was at the end of the text before.
         This is achieved by the new TextComponentAdapter.
         
         Bindings#bind(ValueModel, JTextArea, boolean) and
         Bindings#bind(ValueModel, JTextField, boolean) now use
         the new TextComponentAdapter. And these methods keep
         the text area's/text field's Document, where version 1.1.x
         used a new PlainDocument instead.
         
    107: BeanAdapter#release removes all listeners from the bean
         that have been registered with #addBeanPropertyChangeListener.
         


OTHER CHANGES

    o Marked DocumentAdapter as deprecated. This class will be removed 
      from the JGoodies Binding version 1.3.
    o Marked Bindings#bind(ValueModel, JTextArea, Document, boolean) and
      Bindings#bind(ValueModel, JTextField, Document, boolean) as deprecated.
      These methods will be removed from the Binding version 1.3.

                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release fixes a bug and brings minor source code improvements.

    
BUGS FIXED

    o Issue 100: Deadlock in ExtendedPropertyChangeSupport
                 with identity check enabled.


NEW FEATURES

    The PropertyConnector can now connect beans that do not
    support bound properties. This is intended for the case
    where only one bean fires property change events.
    

OTHER CHANGES

    o Marked several inner classes as final.
    o Added JavaDocs and fixed JavaDoc typos.
    o FAQ is now online at https://binding.dev.java.net/faq.html.
    o Added a reference to the JSR 295 - Beans Binding.

                            Version 1.1.1 
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes issue #87 and bug #92.
    It is recommended to use version to 1.1.1.

    
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    The changes affect the behavior, not the binary compatibility.

    o Since 1.1.1 the SelectionInList's default selection holder
      checks the identity. This allows to use it as bean channel
      in PresentationModel, BeanAdapter, PropertyAdapter.
      It may now fire more changes than the previous holder,
      that fired only if the old and new selection were not equal.
    o The fix for issue #92 may lead to more or less events
      fired by all AbstractConverter subclasses.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o Issue 87: SelectionInList default selection holder 
                shall check identity.
    o Issue 92: AbstractConverter converts null event values.


NEW FEATURES

    Most BeanUtils methods allow to provide the bean type now,
    where the bean instance was used before. This makes it easier
    to use package private beans that implement a public interface.
    
          
OTHER CHANGES

    o Changed the visibility for enclosed types to reduce 
      the amount of synthetic accessors.
    o Fixed JavaDoc typos.
    o Minor source style improvements.
    o The ANT build can create a Maven bundle.

                        JGoodies Data Binding
                             Version 1.1
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release fixes bugs and provides new features and classes.
    It is recommended to upgrade your library version to 1.1.
    
    The 1.1 API is slightly incompatible with previous versions.
    However, existing valid code will typically work as before.
    Most changes are sanity checks; they ensure that arguments 
    comply with constraints that are described in the JavaDocs.
    
    The topics for the 1.1 release are:
    1) Bug fixing and API clarification.
    2) New distribution layout. 
    3) Move stable extra sources to the library core.
    4) Improved support for PropertyVetoExceptions.  
    5) Improved support in the presentation model layer
       for operating on frequently used component state:
       enabled, editable, visible. This is implemented
       by the new class ComponentValueModel. 

    Due to a timely rollout of the 1.1 final, other improvements 
    planned for the 1.1. version have been moved to future releases. 
    The work on version 1.2 will begin immediately, and the 
    list handling classes available in the 1.1 preview builds 
    will be moved back to the library core.
        

CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o SelectionInList keeps the selection after list changes,
      even if the selection is cleared during the change.
      This happens for example when the SelectionInList is bound
      to a JTable that may - as a side effect - clear the selection 
      in JTable#tableChanged (see also issue 85).
      
    o The methods Bindings#bind(JTextComponent, *) have been replaced 
      by Bindings#bind(JTextArea, *) and #bind(JTextField, *).
      This clarifies that these methods were not intended
      (and not able) to bind JEditorPanes and JTextPanes.

    The changes below are sanity checks that have been added
    to verify that parameters comply with the constraints
    that are described in the JavaDocs.
    
    o BeanAdapter and PresentationModel methods that get a
      property name throw an NPE if the property name is null.
      
    o PresentationModel, BeanAdapter and PropertyAdapter
      throw an IllegalArgumentException if the bean channel
      is a ValueHolder that has the identityCheck feature disabled.
      
    o SelectionInList throws an IllegalArgumentException 
      if the listHolder is a ValueModel that has 
      the identity check feature disabled.
      
    o SelectionInList constructor throws a ClassCastException
      if the list holder content is neither a List nor a ListModel.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o Issue 78: SelectionInList#EmptyListModel may cause memory leak.
    o Issue 79: PropertyConnector updates a read-only property.
    o Issue 82: Clarify interval of list model content changes.
    o Issue 85: SelectionInList loses selection when bound to a table. 
    
    
DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o Issue 74: The sources no longer ship as a source Zip archive.
      They now come in the directory structure used by the CVS. 
      This makes it easier to build the distribution using ANT.     
      If you want to attach the library sources in an IDE, 
      point to folder 'src/core'.
    
    
NEW FEATURES

    o Issue 73: Improve support for constrained bean properties:
        + PropertyAdapter#setVetoableValue(Object)
        + BeanAdapter#setVetoableValue(String, Object)
        + BeanAdapter.SimplePropertyAdapter#setVetoableValue(Object)
        
    o Issue 75: Add access to (buffered) values to PresentationModel:
        + PresentationModel#getValue(String)
        + PresentationModel#setValue(String, Object)
        + PresentationModel#setVetoableValue(String, Object)
        + PresentationModel#getBufferedValue(String)
        + PresentationModel#setBufferedValue(String, Object)
                
    o Issue 76: Move extras to the library core:
        + com.jgoodies.binding.adapter.SpinnerAdapterFactory
        + com.jgoodies.binding.adapter.SpinnerToValueModelConnector
        + com.jgoodies.binding.beans.DelayedPropertyChangeHandler
        + com.jgoodies.binding.value.AbstractVetoableValueModel
        + com.jgoodies.binding.value.DelayedReadValueModel
        
    o Issue 77: Provide component state in the PresentationModel. 
      A ComponentValueModel provides bound properties for: 
      enabled, visible, editable. The Bindings class can register 
      a handler with the ComponentValueModel that updates 
      the component's state automatically. And the PresentationModel 
      has new factory methods that vend a plain or buffered
      ComponentValueModel. Added:
        + com.jgoodies.binding.value.ComponentValueModel
        + Bindings#addComponentPropertyHandler
        + Bindings#removeComponentPropertyHandler
        + PresentationModel#getComponentModel(String)
        + PresentationModel#getBufferedComponentModel(String) 
      For an example see the ComponentValueModel class comment
      and the tutorial's ComponentValueModel example.
      This feature is implemented for text components, radio buttons 
      and check boxes. Lists, tables, combos and color choosers 
      bound using the Bindings class, ignore the ComponentValueModel. 
      See also issue #86 in the Binding's issue tracker.
        
    o New classes for indirect access to Lists and ListModels:
        + ListHolder is a ListModel that holds a List in a ValueModel.
        + ListModelHolder is a ListModel that holds a ListModel
          in a ValueModel.
          
    o New Extra source: The NonNullValueModel converts null values
      in #getValue to a given default value.
          
          
OTHER CHANGES

    o Improved and corrected JavaDocs.
    o Added tests for writing a constrained bean property.
    o Added a bunch of tests for SelectionInList list changes.
    o Minor Java source style improvements.
    o Fixed an NPE in the tutorial's ComponentsExample.
